Better arg parsing for python

# Why?
Python has pretty good argument parsing, but there's almost always something I feel like I have to work around.

# What?
This project is currently a placeholder for me to record my gripes.  Feel free to add yours.  If at some point I eventually decide it's worth my time to implement, I'll try to make a better arg parser for python.
